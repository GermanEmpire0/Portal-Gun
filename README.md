# Portal-Gun
Behold, the portal gun! Sorry for my absence, I have been learning lots of C#. Anyways I have a warning, please note there will be a loud sound in the beginning of Gorilla Tag ( When you join a modded lobby ), thats just the portal gun telling you that it is activated.  

Controls: 

A for blue portal, 
B for an orange portal.
Y to reboot the portal gun, destroying the portals.
X for Music
Trigger to stop the music.

THE MOD REQUIRES UTILLA!
